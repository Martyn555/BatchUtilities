# BatchUtilities

For libraries to work, upload them to %systemroot%\system32\

It's best to use libraries after @echo off.

**BatchUtilities currently allows:**
1. Display help for commands after entering <command> help.
2. Colorful inscriptions.
3. Colorful text.
4. Performing operations on floating point numbers.
5. Change the character encoding.

Libraries only work properly on Windows 10, as they require powershel.
BatchUtilities is still under development - features are being improved and new ones added.
